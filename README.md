# Deviant Download

## Why?
DeviantArt now forces Eclipse layout on users. There are several issues with Eclipse at the moment, but the one this script solves is images not having a download button, and image downloads defaulting to a random string as filename. Previously, filenames would be something akin to ```[title]-[randomstring]_by_[username]```.

That functionality is back. Enjoy :)

## How to use:
Use a script injection tool or similar. I've only tested with [CSS and Javascript Injection by 孙国强](
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-and-javascript-inject/ckddknfdmcemedlmmebildepcmneakaa). If you know of any issues with that plugin, please let me know.

- Open DeviantArt.
- Open your script injection plugin
- Paste downloadButton.js into the Javascript tab
- Paste downloadButton.css into the CSS tab
- Hover the image, and the download button should become visible
